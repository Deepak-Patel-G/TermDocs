# TermDocs 

This is a new project I am starting for a weekend. I am always thought we developers use internet so much for looking for solutions, documentation. 
What if there is no internet for a while how would we work. Also to search we have to leave terminal and to go web browser. 
Web Browser a memory hog, need to use mouse at some point in a browser even if we are using vim plugins.

So this project will be a terminal based keyboard centric documentation search tool.

Intially I am thinking of having a TUI done in a ftxui and fuzzy search the docs based on languages and other parameters.
